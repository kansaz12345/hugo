Build and maintain a routine

Homesickness is at it core missing the feeling of familiar. When you create a routine and stick to it, you give yourself something to be familiar with reducing and eliminating your homesickness.

Recreate your cultural environment at university

Being at university foes not mean you cannot be yourself anymore, and you are a product of your cultural environment, so bring it with you. If there is something you did regularly at home, such as say prayers, continue to do it on campus too. All universities offer students a place to practice their religious rituals and continue their worship, and often you will find student organizations that are culturally inclined. You may even have the opportunity to celebrate special holidays together and eat some of your favourite foods.

Food therapy

Eating a meal is an important activity in many cultures. In many cultures families eat together at one place which is a very rich cultural experience. It is widely agreed upon that when we eat together, we create strong bond and positive associations with the people and food. So, get a friend or two to sit down and sample new food at mealtimes.

Be a tourist

Visiting new places as a tourist seldomly makes anyone feel homesick because they are excited by the new experiences and want to absorb as much of the locale as you can. Approaching university life with same sense of exploration can result in having some really nice experiences. Find a favourite spot to study, find new paths between your dorm and campus buildings. Seek out a restaurant that serves food from your home country.

Limit communication from friends and family back home

Missing someone automatically makes you lean towards them further and also prevents you from forming new alliances. Talking to them any less will not break your old and strong bonds but being constantly busy in them will stop you from making new good ones here. It is important to give them updates about your life but you also need to live the life you are giving them the updates about. Explore your surroundings and take pictures of stuffs you like. You will enjoy the place more when you start to really look at it.
